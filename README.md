# 🚀 Overview


1. Research Copilot is an AI-powered research assistant designed to help users deeply analyze research papers, articles, and technical documents using Large Language Models (LLMs) and a multi-agent AI system.

2. Instead of simple summarization, the system decomposes research tasks into smaller subtasks handled by specialized agents, enabling accurate insights, contextual understanding, and structured outputs.

3. This project demonstrates applied GenAI, backend engineering, and production deployment skills.
